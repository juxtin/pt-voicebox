Upon hearing this Heracles went to Tiryns and proceeded to carry out the instructions of Eurystheus. First he was assigned to fetch the skin of the Nemean lion, an invulnerable animal sired by Typhon. As he went out to find the lion, he came to Cleonae, where he was a guest at the home of a poor man named Molorchus. Molorchus wanted to make an animal sacrifice, but Heracles told him to hold off for thirty days, and then, if he returned safe and sound from the hunt, to sacrifice to Zeus Soter, but if he were dead, to sacrifice to Heracles himself as a hero. He then went to Nemea, found the lion, and shot it first with arrows. But when he knew for sure that it was invulnerable, he picked up his club and started after it. It escaped into a double-mouthed cave, but Heracles blocked up one of the mouths, and ran in after the creature through the other. He encircled its neck with his arm, and by squeezing choked it to death. He then draped it over his shoulders and took it back to Cleonae. There he found Molorchus on the thirtieth day about to offer sacrifice to him as a dead man; but he himself sacrificed instead to Zeus Soter, and took the lion to Mycenae.
